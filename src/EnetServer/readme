#EnetServer

- Modifiy main.cpp to configure server IP and port 
- Build server : g++ *.cpp -lenet -o enetserver
- Launch server : ./enetserver


#Existing Clients

- Set server adress:port into Map Controller Settings -> udp_server_address and udp_send_port
- Set server adress:port into Bridge Command Settings -> udp_server_address and udp_send_port

#Private Client

- You can now send message from any clients to the server.
- Messages will be broadcasted to all the clients, and consumed if needed.

#TODO

- Remove broadcast to peer to peer client/server
- Add a checkbox to activate Enet client/server mode
- Maybe launch server into main BridgeCommand
